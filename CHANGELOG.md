All notable changes to shinywidgets will be documented in this file.

and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.2.1]

* Actually export `as_widget()` (it was mistakenly not exported in 0.2.0).

## [0.2.0] - 2023-04-13

* Closed #43: Fixed an issue where widgets would sometimes not load in a dynamic UI context. (#91, #93)
* Closed #14: Added a `bokeh_dependency()` function to simplify use of bokeh widgets. (#85)
* Closed #89: Exported `as_widget()`, which helps to coerce objects into ipywidgets, and is especially helpful for creating ipywidget objects before passing to `register_widget()` (this way, the ipywidget can then be updated in-place and/or used as a reactive value (`reactive_read()`)). (#90)
* Closed #94: New `SHINYWIDGETS_CDN` and `SHINYWIDGETS_CDN_ONLY` environment variables were added to more easily specify the CDN provider. Also, the default provider has changed from <unpkg.com> to <cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm> (#95)
* A warning is no longer issued (by default) when the path to a local widget extension is not found. This is because, if an internet connection is available, the widget assests are still loaded via CDN. To restore the previous behavior, set the `SHINYWIDGETS_EXTENSION_WARNING` environment variable to `"true"`. (#95)
* Closed #86: Fixed an issue with `{ipyleaflet}` sometimes becoming unresponsive due to too many mouse move event messages being sent to the server. (#98)

## [0.1.6] - 2023-03-24

* Closed #79: make shinywidgets compatible with ipywidgets 8.0.5. (#66)

## [0.1.5] - 2023-03-10

* Stopped use of `_package_dir` function from `htmltools`.

* Miscellaneous typing fixes and updates.

## [0.1.4] - 2022-12-12

### Bug fixes

## [0.1.3] - 2022-12-08
