# Change Log for shinywidgets

All notable changes to shinywidgets will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [UNRELEASED]

* Widgets no longer have a "flash" of incorrect size when first rendered. (#133)
* `@render_widget` now works properly with `Widget`s that aren't `DOMWidget`s (i.e., widgets that aren't meant to be displayed directly). As a result, you can now use `@render_widget` to gain a reference to the widget instance, and then use that reference to update the widget's value. (#133)

## [0.3.0] - 2024-01-25

* The `@render_widget` decorator now attaches a `widget` (and `value`) attribute to the function it decorates. This allows for easier access to the widget instance (or value), and eliminates the need for `register_widget` (which is now soft deprecated).  (#119)
* Added decorators for notable packages that require coercion to the `Widget` class: `@render_altair`, `@render_bokeh`, `@render_plotly`, and `@render_pydeck`. Using these decorators (over `@render_widget`) helps with typing on the `widget` attribute. (#119)
* The `.properties()` method on `altair.Chart` object now works as expected again. (#129)
* Reduce default plot margins on plotly graphs.

## [0.2.4] - 2023-11-20

* Fixed several issues with filling layout behavior introduced in 0.2.3. (#124, #125)
* `reactive_read()` now throws a more informative error when attempting to read non-existing or non-trait attributes. (#120)

## [0.2.3] - 2023-11-13

* Widgets now `fill` inside of a `fillable` container by default. For examples, see the [ipyleaflet](https://github.com/posit-dev/py-shinywidgets/blob/main/examples/ipyleaflet/app.py), [plotly](https://github.com/posit-dev/py-shinywidgets/blob/main/examples/plotly/app.py), or other [output](https://github.com/posit-dev/py-shinywidgets/blob/main/examples/outputs/app.py) examples. If this intelligent filling isn't desirable, either provide a `height` or `fillable=False` on `output_widget()`. (#115)
* `as_widget()` uses the new `altair.JupyterChart()` to coerce `altair.Chart()` into a `ipywidgets.widgets.Widget` instance. (#113)

## [0.2.2] - 2023-10-31

* `@render_widget` now builds on `shiny`'s `render.transformer` infrastructure, and as a result, it works more seamlessly in `shiny.express` mode. (#110)
* Closed #104: Officially support for Python 3.7.

## [0.2.1] - 2023-05-15

* Actually export `as_widget()` (it was mistakenly not exported in 0.2.0).

## [0.2.0] - 2023-04-13

* Closed #43: Fixed an issue where widgets would sometimes not load in a dynamic UI context. (#91, #93)
* Closed #14: Added a `bokeh_dependency()` function to simplify use of bokeh widgets. (#85)
* Closed #89: Exported `as_widget()`, which helps to coerce objects into ipywidgets, and is especially helpful for creating ipywidget objects before passing to `register_widget()` (this way, the ipywidget can then be updated in-place and/or used as a reactive value (`reactive_read()`)). (#90)
* Closed #94: New `SHINYWIDGETS_CDN` and `SHINYWIDGETS_CDN_ONLY` environment variables were added to more easily specify the CDN provider. Also, the default provider has changed from <unpkg.com> to <cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm> (#95)
* A warning is no longer issued (by default) when the path to a local widget extension is not found. This is because, if an internet connection is available, the widget assests are still loaded via CDN. To restore the previous behavior, set the `SHINYWIDGETS_EXTENSION_WARNING` environment variable to `"true"`. (#95)
* Closed #86: Fixed an issue with `{ipyleaflet}` sometimes becoming unresponsive due to too many mouse move event messages being sent to the server. (#98)

## [0.1.6] - 2023-03-24

* Closed #79: make shinywidgets compatible with ipywidgets 8.0.5. (#66)

## [0.1.5] - 2023-03-10

* Stopped use of `_package_dir` function from `htmltools`.

* Miscellaneous typing fixes and updates.

## [0.1.4] - 2022-12-12

## [0.1.3] - 2022-12-08
